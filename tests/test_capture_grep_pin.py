"""Grep-pin: brain.record_payload is the ONLY capture writer.

docs/TRACE-MODES-DESIGN.md rollout step 2 retired the ad-hoc capture
mechanisms — the /tmp prompt/judge dumps and the BRAIN_PROMPT_CAPTURE_DIR
env machinery. This pin keeps them retired: any new code writing (or
reading) capture through those seams fails here and must route through
record_payload / read_payload (in-process) or the sanctioned direct
payload readers (dashboard/db.py, eval fresh_brain.capture_files_for).

Operational STATE files are not capture and are deliberately out of pin
scope: `brain-{session}-current-stop.txt` and the surface-selected
S1R→S1E handoff file (surface_contract.surface_selected_path) survive.

ALLOWLIST — time-bounded legacy: dashboard/queries/recalls.py keeps the
old judge-result filename and dashboard/server.py the old consolidation
filename in their pre-migration read branches; delete each entry when its
branch dies. eval/longmem/connect_ab.py READS a frozen pre-migration
capture corpus (pooled brain-encoding-prompt-*.json) as replay input —
the artifacts predate record_payload and can't be rerouted; delete when
that corpus is regenerated in payload form.
