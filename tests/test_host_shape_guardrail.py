"""Guardrail: no NEW host-shaped literal outside servers/host_contract.py.

The host-contract design's whole point is "a host's tool name or envelope tag
appearing anywhere but the contract is the violation" (docs/HOST-CONTRACT-DESIGN.md).
This test RATCHETS that the way test_raw_sql_guardrail ratchets raw DML: it
freezes today's per-file count of QUOTED host literals across servers/, hooks/
and dashboard/, and fails when a file grows one — forcing the author to route
the decision through the contract (a kind, a policy, a stamped status) or to
consciously bump the baseline with a why.

It ratchets BOTH ways: when a design step retires a site, the count drops and
the test fails too, demanding the baseline be lowered — so an allowance can't
silently hide a later re-introduction.

Detection is deliberately simple: a tool name or host key inside quotes
('Bash', "Edit", 'codex'), or a quoted string containing an envelope tag. Prose
mentions are not counted; a quoted mention inside a comment IS (retirement
bookkeeping — the baseline row says so). The tool-name and host-key sets are
DERIVED from the contract — adding a tool or a host widens the scan and the
baseline must be reconciled, which is the point.

KNOWN BLIND SPOTS, by construction: a name the contract does NOT declare scores
zero here (the detector for a genuinely new host name is the write door
stamping kind_status 'unknown' into the errors table — design step 1), and a
name embedded in a longer string ('Bash: %s') is not an exact quoted name (the
summary heads are held to the contract by test_host_contract.TestHookMirrors).
