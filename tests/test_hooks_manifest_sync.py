"""Contract: the two hook manifests are one set of scripts, projected per host.

hooks/hooks.json is the Claude Code manifest; hooks/hooks.codex.json is the
Codex projection of it — same commands, only the event set and per-host handler
fields differ. Two files that share seven identical handlers drift silently, so
this locks BOTH directions: every Codex handler is backed by a CC handler (same
command, a subset of its tool names) unless it is a declared Codex-only handler
(CODEX_ONLY_HANDLERS, each naming the Claude Code mechanism that replaces it),
and every CC handler on a shared event is projected into the Codex file (minus
the tool names that only exist on Claude Code). Plus the two Codex-specific
constraints — SessionEnd within Codex's 3 s cap, and the injecting hooks
lifting Codex's ~2,500-token spill limit — and timeout parity everywhere else.
Pure file inspection.

The host contract (servers/host_contract.py) DECLARES each host's registered
events, tool names and matcher aliases; the manifests stay the source of truth
(nothing parses them at runtime). TestContractManifestParity holds the two in
step both ways (design D4) — the engine event lists are read from the contract.
