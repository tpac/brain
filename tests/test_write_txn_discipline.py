"""Contract: write-path transaction discipline is STRUCTURAL, not by-convention.

brain_batch (and the bg-writer drain) wrap many sub-ops in one BEGIN IMMEDIATE
/ COMMIT envelope. For that to be atomic, the DAL writers running inside must
NOT self-commit. Pre-2026-05-30 this was enforced by a fragile convention:
every writer took a `commit` kwarg and every batch-context caller had to
remember `commit=not _batch_mode`. We shipped exactly the bug that convention
invites — 3 callers forgot the kwarg; only a code review caught it.

The structural fix (docs/WRITE-TXN-ISOLATION-ROOTFIX.md, Option A): batch state
lives on the CONNECTION (BatchAwareConnection.in_batch); the envelope owner
flips it; writers consult it via commit_unless_batched(). There is no kwarg to
forget. These tests lock that so a future writer can't reintroduce the gap:

1. commit_unless_batched honors conn.in_batch (behavioral).
2. No DAL writer self-commits via a bare `self.conn.commit()` — all route
   through the helper (source contract — fails on a planted regression).
3. The GraphDAL batch-reachable writers expose no `commit` parameter (the old
   forgettable knob is gone — signature contract).
4. The Brain's three SQLite connections are BatchAwareConnection, so in_batch
   is always present in production (wiring contract).
