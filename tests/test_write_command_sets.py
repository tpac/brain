"""The scale write-command classification — derivation invariants.

dispatch.py no longer holds a dispatch factory (S1 Scribe + the S2 units share
the in-process _make_encoder_dispatch). What survives is the canonical
write-command classification the attribution chokepoint reads. These pin the
derivation that keeps a new attributed write tagged automatically — the gap that
once mislabelled brain_batch encodes as 'anchor' and hid them from the encoder
view. (Attribution BEHAVIOR is tested in test_s1_scribe.py via
apply_encoder_attribution; the daemon-subset contract in test_contract_sync.py
Layer 5.)
