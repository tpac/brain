"""Contract: conftest's env guard makes an unrestored env write impossible.

os.environ is process-global and pytest runs the suite in one process, so a
test that sets a variable and doesn't put it back hands that value to every
test after it. That is not hypothetical here — four classes set $BRAIN_DB_DIR
in setUpClass and rmtree'd the directory in tearDownClass, leaving the rest of
the suite pointed at a directory that no longer existed, and resolve_db_dir()
trusts that variable unconditionally (D-13's top rung).

conftest closes it with a snapshot/restore pair — one class-scoped (wraps
setUpClass/tearDownClass), one function-scoped (wraps each test). These tests
assert the guard's BEHAVIOUR, so deleting either fixture from conftest fails
them: a gate that goes green when the mechanism it watches disappears is not a
gate.

Ordering: each leak source is followed by the item that checks it escaped
nothing, and pytest runs items in collection (file) order — requirements-test
pins pytest + pytest-timeout only, no randomizer. A check whose source was
deselected (`-k`, `--lf`, a pasted node id) would pass while asserting about
state nothing perturbed, so each source records that it ran and each check
skips rather than going green on an unexercised guard.
