"""Contract: the run_hook error-boundary standard.

Every event-hook script routes its body through run_hook(name, fn[, on_error]) —
a single error boundary that logs to hook_errors and never lets a hook crash
the host. This test LOCKS that standard so a new hook can't silently swallow
exceptions (the regression that took a ~15-file sweep to fix). It also guards
the two adjacent invariants: no hand-rolled top-level try/except in an event
hook, and no reintroduction of the deleted log_hook_output no-op.

Pure file/AST inspection — no brain, no daemon.
