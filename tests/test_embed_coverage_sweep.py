"""Unscoped vector-coverage sweep (embed_queue._coverage_sweep).

The queue repairs only what reached it. A writer that skips the enqueue
hooks, or a crash between insert and enqueue, leaves a node unembedded
with no other route back — and an unembedded node is invisible to LAF
entirely. This sweep is that route.

It previously lived in `hook_idle_maintenance`, which is driven by a
Claude Code Notification/idle_prompt event. That event stopped firing
2026-07-04 and took vector coverage with it, silently, for six weeks.
These tests hold the contract that it now lives beside the queue that
owns embedding, that it cannot be starved, and that BOTH a gap and a
stuck node are reported.

Pure-function tests — stub brain, no DB, no embedder.
