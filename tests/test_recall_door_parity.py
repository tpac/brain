"""Guard: every recall door hands back the same canonical shape.

Recall has more than one door — MCP by-query, MCP by-id, MCP batch, and the
in-brain hook path — and for months they silently disagreed. `recall_node`
read the bare DB row, so `recall({node_id})` returned a node with NO
corrections, NO situation and NO connections: a superseded claim handed over
with its correction marker stripped off, while the by-query door on the same
node returned all three. `recall_batch` had the same hole.

The fix was one door — `Brain.canonicalize_results` — that every shape routes
through. These tests hold that line, because the failure mode is invisible
from any single door: each one looks fine on its own, and only a comparison
shows the drift.

Two ways the drift comes back, one test each:

1. A NEW door is added that calls brain.recall* directly and skips the
   canonical pull. Caught by `test_recall_producing_handlers_are_known` — a
   tripwire on the set of dispatch handlers that call recall directly, across
   every `servers/dispatch_*.py`. It fails when someone adds one, which is the
   moment to add it to the parity test below. A door that instead DELEGATES to
   `_handle_recall` (as `_handle_recall_batch` does) inherits the canonical
   pull through the single door — it stays out of this set and is held by its
   own behavioural parity case, not this tripwire.

2. `get_node` GROWS an attachment that CANONICAL_ATTACHMENT_KEYS doesn't
   list. Then the doors diverge again on the new field, silently, because the
   overlay only copies what the list names. Caught by
   `test_canonical_keys_cover_what_get_node_attaches`.
