"""The one door an eval or A/B arm uses to put a prompt or config in front of
a run — and to take it back.

Seven eval sites used to hand-roll register+activate, each having
independently rediscovered merge-vs-replace and read-back verification, and
none of them could revert: a forgotten override silently opts that name out
of code defaults for the life of that brain.

Two verbs:

    version = override_interaction(brain, 's1e', template=candidate)

    with interaction_override(brain, 'recall_laf', parameters=gains):
        ...                     # cleared on exit, including on exception

Both route through `brain.register_interaction` / `brain.set_interaction_active`
— never `brain._interaction_dal` — so the `scopes` validator runs at the
register door and every cache keyed on the name is invalidated on the flip.
Reaching past those doors is how an eval override used to read stale for a
whole TTL window, and it was latent only by engine-attach ordering luck.

Reads use the RESOLVER (`get_interaction_prompt` / `get_interaction_config`),
not the row. On a brain with no pointer the row is absent and the code default
is the truth — a `_interaction_dal.get_active` read there returns None, and
`template=None` "preserve what's active" silently becomes "override with an
empty template".

WHY IT CAN VERIFY WITHOUT COMPARING TEMPLATES
`get_interaction_stamp(name)['fingerprint']` is 12 hex over the resolved
(overlaid) template+config, so one comparison covers both halves. An arm
compares arms on that; it never string-compares a multi-KB prompt to decide
whether its own override took. A fingerprint that does not MOVE across the
override is the silent-arm-collapse signal: both arms would
measure the same K and the A/B would report a difference of zero as a result.

Comparing arms is a CROSS-arm assertion, and no single run can make it: each
arm only ever sees its own stamp, which is precisely the gap the old
version-int corpus address hid in. Read each arm's stamp from that arm's own
brain and assert the two differ. ⚠ Reading one means opening a per-item corpus
copy — never the live `brain.db` while the daemon is up: a second writer
connection is how an index gets corrupted (CLAUDE.md). Route a live read
through the daemon (`daemon_client.send_command`) instead.

    `merge=True` overlays the given keys onto the effective config instead of
    storing them alone — needed whenever the stored config also carries state
    you must not wipe (recall_laf's config is the carrier of fitted gains, so
    a wholesale replace would reset a corpus brain's gains to module defaults
    and let a base-parity check pass against a config that brain never ran).
    Side effect to know: the stored row then carries the FULL merged dict, so
    outside the self-reverting CM a merge=True override pins every config key
    against future code-default changes, not just the ones you set.

    Raises RuntimeError if the override did not reach the resolver. Prints a
    loud warning — not an error — when the fingerprint does not move: that is

    an `IsolatedBrain` inherits every production override it snapshot-copied,

    for). It is also the one surprise here: if you need the prior override
    back, capture it and re-apply it yourself. The two-way door Step 6 shipped
    is what makes any of this writable.

    The exit clear is deliberately UNGUARDED, and that is safe for exactly one
    reason: `clear_interaction_override` raises KeyError only for a name that
    deleted nothing AND has no code default (the typo guard — a clear of
    'trace_recoding' must not report "already on the default" while the real
    override keeps running), and no such name can reach this line. Entry reads
    the resolver, which refuses an unregistered name before anything is
    written. So every name that gets here has a code default, and its clear
    returns quietly whether or not a pointer survived the body. A guard here
    would be unreachable, and a `try/except` around a clear in __exit__ is
    worse than unreachable — it is where a leak-proof block turns into an
    error-masking one, swallowing the failure being debugged.
