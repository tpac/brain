"""Aspect Registry — first-class roles/groupings for nodes and edges.

An aspect is a semantic role (correction, identity_bearing, active_thread, ...)
that groups node TYPES and/or edge RELATIONS under a shared meaning. Aspects
live in aspects_v1.json — each entry carries its own member lists (the
node_types / edge_relations it claims). The registry reads that file directly;
aspects are NOT brain nodes.

Two tiers:
  - Required aspects (locked): code routes on these by string. Must always
    exist. Listed in REQUIRED_ASPECTS — single source of truth for the
    required NAMES, mirrored by aspects_v1.json keys (test enforces
    equivalence). On boot the registry validates they are present in the JSON
    and logs loudly if any are missing (no auto-heal — the JSON is the spec).
  - Emergent aspects (unlocked): discovered by S2's AspectIntegration unit
    as the brain accumulates new types/relations. Created freely.

Consumers (every name string in the codebase flows through here):
  - Frame: brain.aspects.identity_bearing.node_types (etc.)
  - S2 community/consolidation: brain.aspects.relations_in(['noise', ...])
  - S2 classifier: per-aspect facts (routable/accepts) drive menu + validation
  - Healer: brain.aspects.<name>.metadata.display_label
  - Surface: brain.aspects.relation_meaning_map() for embedding composition;
    spread activation rides brain.aspects.lineage_relations
  - MCP graph_expand: brain.aspects.traversal_exclusions

from_dict() constructs a registry without a brain (for tests/seeding); the
production path is _load(), which reads aspects_v1.json directly.

    Four jobs, all idempotent and safe to call on every boot:
      1. First boot — working copy missing → copy the whole seed (atomic).
      2. Missing aspect — the seed has a REQUIRED aspect the working copy
         lacks → add the whole aspect from the seed.
      3. Missing member — a REQUIRED aspect's seed `node_types` /
         `edge_relations` list names a string the working copy's list lacks
         → APPEND it. This is how a curated membership fix (e.g. multi-homing
         a replacement verb into correction_improvement, which recall walks)
         reaches an existing brain. Without it a seed member edit propagates
         to fresh installs only, and every existing brain keeps the defect
         while the seed-based contract tests pass.
      4. Missing fact field — a REQUIRED aspect's working-copy entry lacks
         one of ASPECT_FACT_KEYS that the seed carries → copy the seed's
         value. A PRESENT value is never overwritten (additive, like
         members): a deliberate working-copy divergence survives; only
         omissions heal.

    An UNPARSEABLE working copy is quarantined (renamed aside, preserving the
    operator's classifier-grown members for manual recovery) and re-seeded —
    the old return-False path left the registry permanently empty on every
    subsequent boot, which its own comments called catastrophic.

    ADDITIVE ONLY, in both directions of scope:
      · Members are appended, never reordered or removed — operator- and
        AspectIntegration-grown lists survive, and append-at-end cannot
        evict anything from the first-8 window `render_edge_aspects_block`
        shows the encoders.
      · A seed REMOVAL does not propagate. Retiring a member (or moving one
        between aspects) still needs a supervised migration; this heals
        omissions, not disagreements.
      · Only REQUIRED aspects are touched. Emergent/unlocked aspects are the
        classifier's to own.

    Never writes the seed itself (tests may point the working path at it).
    Returns True if the file was created or modified. `log_fn(message)` — when
    given — is called with a one-line summary of what was healed: a member heal
    silently changes which edges `correction_enrich` walks, so it announces
    itself rather than being inferred from behaviour later.
