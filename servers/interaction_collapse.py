"""The one-time install collapse: reclassify seeded interaction rows as
"no override deployed" so every name starts following its code default.

Create-only seeding gave each install a DB row for every interaction name, and
under the override model a row that merely *restates* the shipped default reads
as a deployment decision — freezing that name against every future code change.
This module drops those pointers once, per install, so the accessors resolve to
the code default the way the override model always claimed they did.

**Pointer-only. Zero row deletes.** `interactions` rows are the override history
AND the target of thousands of resolvable historical trace pointers, on a column
with no `REFERENCES` clause — deleting rows raises nothing and silently orphans
display data. Only `interaction_active` pointers are touched, so every version
stays re-activatable.

**Daemon-only.** `ensure_logs_schema` runs
inside `Brain.__init__`, so shipping this as a `LOGS_MIGRATIONS` step would fire
it in frozen eval corpora, `IsolatedBrain` copies and test brains. Effective
values are unchanged at that instant — that IS the predicate — but a collapsed
corpus then floats with future code edits, which is exactly what a frozen corpus
must never do. The daemon is a launchd singleton that runs this before the port
opens, so there is one writer and eval brains never reach it.

**The classifier is fingerprint equality, never `source`.** A row byte-identical
to the code default still stamps `source='override'`, because `source` reports
whether a row contributed, not whether it deviated.

**Why the audit record is the rollback path, not a transaction.** Pointer drops
go through the interactions DAL (its own write connection, committing per call
so the write lock is released) while the version stamp goes through
`brain.logs_conn` — two connections on one file. So there is no single envelope
to roll back. Instead the audit is committed BEFORE the first drop and never
overwritten, which is strictly stronger: it survives a hard crash mid-collapse,
where a rollback would leave no record of what was attempted.

**Rolling back by hand** is a pure replay of the audit —
`set_interaction_active(name, version, set_by)` per entry — AND deleting the
`interaction_collapse_version` row from `logs_meta`. Skipping that second half
puts the pointers back on an install that will never re-collapse.

#          the code default is not an override, so drop the pointer; a row that
#          differs is a real local decision and is kept.
# ADOPT    drop unconditionally. These have a code default but their row can
#          never converge with it, so COMPARE would guarantee permanent override
#          status for content nothing wants: `s2_community`'s row holds 8 keys
#          against the code dict's 25 with one in common and no reader at all,
#          and the two mustered-out scouts carry an `output_schema` the code
#          dicts deliberately omit — an omission tests/test_prompt_sync.py
#          asserts, so code and DB are held apart by contract.
# PIN      never touched. `trace_recording` is the one name where activating the
#          wrong version turns on full payload capture for every LLM round, and
#          it is the only name whose active version is deliberately not its
#          highest. The conservative verdict costs one inert pointer.
# SKIP     never touched. `recall_laf`'s row carries measured gain tuning the
#          code default does not, so COMPARE would keep it anyway — SKIP says
#          not to look, so a future predicate change cannot reclassify a real
#          measurement into a drop.
# RETIRE   drop unconditionally. These names have NO code default — they are the
#          seven `INTERACTION_DEFAULTS` names as "deliberately absent": four
#          retired names whose every config key grepped reader-less, and three
#          dead legacy names. Their rows are inert history; the pointer is the
#          only part that still asserts anything.
#
# The RETIRE bucket is exactly the set of names without a code default, and
# every other bucket requires one. `test_interaction_collapse.py` holds that
# correspondence, so the table cannot drift from the registry.
