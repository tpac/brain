"""Host contract — one declaration per harness, the brain's only knowledge of a
host's dialect.

One concern: everything the brain must know about a HARNESS (Claude Code,
Codex, a later Grok or local model) to translate what it observes into the
host-neutral vocabulary of trace_contract — which env tells identify it, what
its tool names mean, what its prompt envelopes are, which hook events it
registers, what it is known to be blind to, and which build the entry was
verified against. Consumers past the boundary read the OUTPUT vocabulary
(trace_contract.ACTION_KINDS, KIND_STATUS, HOST_STATUS, ENVELOPE_POLICIES)
and never a host's name; this is the only file where a NEW host literal may
appear — tests/test_host_shape_guardrail.py ratchets every other file's
remaining sites down, both ways, as the design's steps retire them. The ratchet
knows only names this contract declares; a genuinely new host name is caught by
the write door stamping kind_status 'unknown' into the errors table (step 1).

Three precedents, one shape: contract.PROMOTED_FIELDS (entries carry
behaviour, consumers derive), interaction_defaults (validators plus a content
fingerprint), aspects (a closed registry validated at boot — loud, no
auto-heal). Design: docs/HOST-CONTRACT-DESIGN.md.

A LEAF, by measurement: imports only trace_contract, itself a leaf with no path
to daemon_config (whose import-time fingerprint of servers/ costs ~22 ms). The
prompt hook may import this; the PostToolUse hook never does — see below.
Pinned by tests/test_host_contract.py::TestLeaf.

WHERE CLASSIFICATION RUNS (D9 — classify at the first consumer's boundary):
- tool kinds: the DAEMON, at the S0 write door, from the raw name the hook
  sent. The first consumer of a kind is the encoder hours later; classifying
  there is restart-deployable and every row from every client gets the same
  vocabulary on the same day. The hook stays a bare socket send.
- envelopes: the PROMPT HOOK, which consumes the class itself — a wake envelope
  is routed register_only with a short timeout before the daemon is called.
- identity: the hook OBSERVES (which tell env vars are present — names only),
  the daemon RESOLVES (resolve_host). The env is visible only in the hook
  process; the rule lives here.

ADDING A HOST — the complete recipe (a step skipped ships a host that looks
supported and classifies as unknown):
1. Entry below: identity.tells, tools (+ tool_patterns), matcher_aliases when
   the manifest matches names other than the ones the payload carries,
   envelopes, transcript, events (== the host's manifest), engine_events (the
   host's documented event list, dated by verified.host_version), blind,
   record, manifest, verified.
2. Manifest: hooks/hooks.<host>.json — tests/test_hooks_manifest_sync.py holds
   it to hooks.json AND to this entry (D4: declared, test-verified).
3. Run tests/test_host_contract.py and test_hooks_manifest_sync.py: validator,
   manifest parity, hook mirror and leaf pin all fail loudly on a partial entry.
4. Bump VOCAB_VERSION only when an existing host's tools/envelopes CHANGE
   meaning — rows stamp the version that classified them.

TWO DOORS: validate_host_contract() is the write door — the sync test refuses
a violating entry before merge, and Brain.__init__ logs every violation to
the errors table at boot (loud, non-fatal, no auto-heal). classify_tool /
resolve_host / envelope_policy are the read doors: an unknown name yields an
explicit 'unknown' status, never a guess and never a KeyError.
