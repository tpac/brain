"""brain — Mutation-Trace Emitter

THE one writer of graph-mutation traces. Every node born, revised, archived or
erased, and every edge relation touched, becomes a trace row here and nowhere
else. Called from `daemon_dispatch.dispatch_command` — the single execution
chokepoint — after the handler returns.

Design record: docs/MUTATION-EMITTER-DESIGN.md. Work order:
docs/MUTATION-EMITTER-PLAN.md.

WHAT REPLACED WHAT
    Before, eleven hand-rolled `_emit_*` call sites in dispatch_write.py plus an
    inline trace in brain_remember.archive_node each decided their own timing,
    scale, chain and attribution. Ten of the twelve could emit while brain.conn
    was still inside the brain_batch envelope, producing a durable trace for a
    graph write that then rolled back. Creates emitted nothing at all.

THE UNIFICATION IS DATA, NOT CODE
    One table (`MANIFEST_TRACE_MAP`), one loop. Everything that used to vary
    per site is a column: ref_type, ref_id shape, metadata builder, emit
    predicate, chain fallback. Adding a sixth mutation kind must be one table
    row plus one builder in trace_contract — if it needs a branch in this file,
    the unification is fake. `tests/test_mutation_emitter.py` pins that.

WHAT THIS FILE GUARANTEES
    * POST-COMMIT, and it CHECKS rather than assumes (see the in_transaction
      gate). The stated asymmetry: a missing trace is recoverable from the graph;
      an orphaned trace lies about it. Prefer missing.
    * Per-row scale and chain, derived from each row's OWN encoding_source — one
      brain_batch can carry an s2:consolidation archive and an anchor revise, and
      they must not land on the same chain.
    * One append_batch per command, however many mutations it carried. Row
      VOLUME is unchanged; only the commit count collapses.
    * Never raises into the caller. A trace failure is loud (brain._log_error)
      and the write still succeeds — the graph is the truth.
