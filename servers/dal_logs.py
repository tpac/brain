"""
brain — Data Access Layer (DAL): logs & traces (brain_logs.db)

Access layer for the four brain_logs.db-backed concerns: raw debug/hook
logs (LogsDAL), versioned prompt/config templates (InteractionDAL), the
fractal trace-event chain (TraceDAL), and per-session ephemeral state
(SessionStateDAL). Split out of dal.py (which now holds the brain.db
classes) along the one structural boundary that matters: which SQLite
file owns the table.

Usage in brain.py:
    from servers.dal_logs import LogsDAL, TraceDAL

    self._logs = LogsDAL(self.logs_conn, write_conn=self.logs_conn_w,
                         write_lock=self.write_lock)
    self._trace_dal = TraceDAL(self.logs_conn, write_conn=self.logs_conn_w,
                               write_lock=self.write_lock)

Read/write connection split (2026-08-18): brain_logs.db writes were silently
dropped by SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT — the shared connection held read snapshots
(concurrent read dispatch + embed-drain cursors) while writing, and a
read->write upgrade from a stale snapshot fails INSTANTLY, bypassing
busy_timeout entirely (brain id:371895a8). The invariant that kills the
mechanism: `wconn` is touched ONLY inside `_wlock` (the daemon passes
brain.logs_write_lock — a leaf lock, separate from the graph write_lock so
log writes never queue behind graph batches), and every statement on it is
FULLY CONSUMED before the next write — fetchall(), or a single-step lookup
whose cursor is discarded (CPython refcount finalizes it immediately; do not
bind such a cursor to a name). No open cursor means no held snapshot, so
every write transaction begins at the WAL head. Multi-row table scans belong
on the shared read `conn`, where open cursors are harmless. Single-connection
construction (write_conn omitted) keeps the old behavior for standalone use.

See servers/dal.py for the brain.db-backed classes (nodes, edges, vectors, ...).

            session_id: Full session UUID
            limit: Max turns to return (most recent if no around_timestamp)
            around_timestamp: ISO timestamp to center the window on.
                If provided, returns `before` turns before + `after` turns after
                this timestamp instead of the most recent `limit`.
            before: Turns before around_timestamp (default 10)
            after: Turns after around_timestamp (default 5)
            with_judge_output: fill judge_output on user turns (one extra
                query over the window's recall chains). Callers that only
                read role/content pass False.
            with_surfaced: fill `surfaced` on user turns — the memories the
                surface selected for that turn ([{id, title}], from the s1
                surface_selected K trace's 'id8|title' detail). Consumed by
                the v13 XML surface layout as per-turn <shown> elements.
                Shares the recall-chain collection with judge_output; adds
                one query over the window's chains when enabled.
            exclude_trace_id: trace_event id of one row to drop. The
                user_message trace is written at prompt-arrival (not Stop),
                so mid-turn readers that want PREVIOUS turns only — the
                surface conversation window, prior-query embeddings — pass
                the current prompt's trace id (returned by the append).
                Keyed on the trace row, NOT the chain: after an interrupt
                the current chain also holds the previous real prompt,
                which must stay in the window. Readers that want the
                conversation as-is (Scribe, historic lookups) omit it.
            older_than: ISO timestamp, strict `created_at <` bound applied
                in SQL — positions the newest-first LIMIT window at a
                historical instant (the LAF replay as-of cut) instead of
                clipping at wall-now and post-filtering the wrong rows.
                Strict on purpose: a replay's cue row sits exactly AT as_of
                and must not enter its own window.
