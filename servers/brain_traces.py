"""The traces functional layer — every trace read (and API-level write) on Brain.

One rule, no judgment: reading or writing traces through the API? It's a
`brain.` method, and it lives HERE. Only this file touches TraceDAL; the
vocabulary (ref types, turn classification, journal parse/render) stays in
trace_contract.py. Sanctioned direct-DAL exceptions: the recall scoring
engines' vector-substrate pulls (`event_vector_rows` — brain_recall's
trace-chain lane, recall_laf's episodic matrix), embed_queue's vector
substrate maintenance (`find_unembedded`/`store_embeddings`), and the
read-only dashboard.

Sections:
- Generic door   — query_traces, get_trace, get_traces, count_traces
- Journal + arc  — journal_notes, write_journal_notes, write_session_arc
- Episodic       — recall_episodes (decode-over-traces sibling of recall)
- Conversation   — get_conversation, turns_since_last_encode,
                   get_conversation_around (context grouped by session)

Traces are the universal record of the whole fractal — S0 exchanges, S1 runs,
S2 runs — so these are brain-level capabilities: they span every scale, owned
by none. Scale packages (scales/s0|s1|s2) host integration units, never data
access; scale is a tag in the substrate, not a boundary in the read path.

        sharing the run's chain_id.

        caller can close what they name. The traces layer only partitions; it
        never imports a channel and holds no routing policy.

        Returns a structured result so the caller (and the trace) can see what
        happened: `{'written': int, 'malformed': int, 'status': str,
        'addressed': [...], 'resolved': [...]}` where status is one of:

                                   of valid notes was harvested (drift, logged loud)
          • 'empty_review'       — a fenced review that was empty (a legit clean run)

        LOUD BY DEFAULT — nothing is dropped silently. The encoder is expected
        to ALWAYS emit a `## Review` section (empty fence on a clean run), so a
        missing section or a broken fence is real drift and gets a warning. A
        malformed line, a subject-less note, or unbuildable metadata each logs
        loud and is skipped — one bad note never sinks the rest. If notes parsed
        but none survived, that's an accidental full drop → loud. The whole body
        is failure-isolated: any unexpected error is logged loud and swallowed —
        a journal write must never break or roll back the encoder's actual run.

        OLDEST lines from the front — the digest is a rolling journey, newest
        movement last. Caller passes its contract value (S1E:
        ENCODING_AGENT['session_context_limit']).

        Returns {'written': bool, 'status': str} where status is one of:
          • 'ok'              — a non-empty arc line appended
          • 'empty_arc'       — fenced arc present but empty (legit: nothing
                                progressed this run)
          • 'no_arc_section'  — no `## Arc` at all (drift — the block was
                                injected, the encoder ignored it)
          • 'no_arc_extracted'— `## Arc` present but no parseable fence (drift)
          • 'error'           — unexpected failure (isolated; never breaks
                                the encoder's run)

        LOUD BY DEFAULT — an opted-in encoder is expected to ALWAYS emit
        `## Arc` (empty fence when nothing moved), so a missing section or a
        broken fence logs a warning. An empty fence is visible (debug), not
        an alarm.

        Needles (composable): query (semantic — ranks vs trace_embeddings;
        s0-only today) and/or contains (substring over summary + metadata).
        Frame: session_id | session_ids, scale (default 's0'; '' = all),
        event_type, ref_type, time bounds (older_than / younger_than accept ISO
        or relative shorthand). With no session scope and no time bound at all,
        a default EPISODE_DEFAULT_WINDOW_DAYS lower bound is applied so an
        unbounded scan can't walk the whole append-only table; an explicit
        older_than is left as-is (no forced floor).

        ref_type: a str (one type) or a list (several). UNSET → the conversation
        default, PINNED to operator dialogue (OPERATOR_DIALOGUE_REF_TYPES —
        deliberately not the dial: flipped correspondents like self_message /
        thalamus_delivery stay opt-in via explicit ref_type, like tool_result)
        at s0 — so the default tracks the contract and can't drift, and
        non-conversational s0 traffic (tool_result, heartbeat, structural
        deltas) stays out of the common query. Pass ref_type='tool_result' for
        the "what I did with files/commands" lens, or SAID_AND_DID_REF_TYPES for
        the interleaved said+did timeline. Non-s0 scales have no conversational
        notion, so unset means all ref_types at that scale.

        Ordering: with query, ranked by relevance (each episode carries _score);
        otherwise by created_at (sort_order 'desc' default = latest first).

                 dict {limit, coverage_start, coverage_end, note} when the +1
                 probe proves the window held more; the SEMANTIC path (ranked
                 top-k — truncation is its contract) keeps a bare bool: True
                 when more matched than were ranked (hit limit or the
                 candidate cap). Truthiness works for both; only the dict

        minutes, newest first, excluding the caller.

        Wall-clock is correct here: presence is real-time, not conversation-time,
        so it's exempt from the conversation_now() rule like other bookkeeping

        session_state.updated_at — the latter is bumped by the autosave loop for
        every cached session, so it falsely marks idle/stale sids "live" (and a
        window relaunched under a new sid would linger forever). Traces only
        record actual turns, so the signal is honest.
