"""Dispatch handlers for the self channel — presence (pull) + signal (reach).

Thin command surface over servers/channels/self_channel/{presence,signal}.py.
- presence (self_presence / self_peek): read-only look at other streams.
- signal   (self_send / self_inbox):    directed message + consume-once drain.
Signal's brain_logs.db writes go through brain.write_lock inside signal.py;
none of these touch brain.db, so all register is_write=False.

Handler contract (shared by all daemon commands):
    handler(brain, args, graph_changes) -> {"ok": True, "result": <payload>}

Every handler MUST return the {"ok", "result"} envelope, like every other
dispatch_*.py handler. The table dispatch in daemon_server sends the return
verbatim — a raw, un-enveloped dict reaches the MCP client (brain_mcp) as a
falsy `ok` with no `error`, surfacing as the misleading "Unknown daemon error"
even though the handler succeeded. test_self_dispatch.py locks this.
