brain — Recall Write Queue

Deferred-write queue for recall-side bookkeeping that does NOT need realtime
persistence. The recall hot path enqueues; the embed_queue worker drains
every EMBED_DRAIN_INTERVAL seconds via `brain.conn_bg_writer`.

One signal rides on this queue:

  enqueue_access(node_id, session_id, ts)
    Recognition signal. Per-(node, session, drain-window) dedup'd by Dict
    semantics — the value held is the most recent timestamp seen. Drain
    produces ONE atomic UPDATE per unique (node, session) pair:
        access_count = access_count + 1
        activation   = MIN(1.0, activation + 0.1)
        last_accessed = ts (max within window)
    Multiple accesses to the same node from the same session within one
    drain window collapse to a single +1. Cross-session accesses to the
    same node still produce one increment per session.

(The Hebbian co_accessed signal that used to share this queue was retired
2026-08-17 — node ab56d25a. The surface_selected traces remain the durable
co-access substrate.)

Design constraints (operator: Tom):
  - No silent errors. Every except logs via brain._log_error.
  - No read-modify-write where SQL can do +1 atomically.
  - Hot path is pure enqueue — no DB I/O.

Loss semantics (accepted by operator):
  - Daemon crash mid-drain: pending queue (≤ EMBED_DRAIN_INTERVAL seconds
    of recalls) lost. access_count is approximate.
  - Transaction failure: ROLLBACK + drop the batch + log loudly. No retry
    queue (avoids poison-pill loops).

Stats (get_stats) feed dashboard observability.
