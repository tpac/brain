"""Self-channel signal — the directed message (Phase 2a, pull courier).

The "hearing" half of self<->self: one stream sends a message addressed to
another live stream (self:<sid>) or to self:broadcast; the recipient consumes
it once. Presence is the passive look; a signal is a deliberate reach — Anchor
authors it, unlike the encoder-written letter.

Storage: the `self_inflight` courier in brain_logs.db (schema.LOG_TABLES), with
consumption tracked in `self_delivered` (one row per (message, recipient) — so
broadcast fans out and each recipient consumes exactly once). Phase 2a is PULL:
a recipient drains its inbox on demand. Phase 2b wires auto-delivery into
Observation at a hook (traced as the s0 `self_message` marker).

Writes go through `brain.write_lock` around `brain.logs_conn` — the canonical
shared-logs-writer pattern (see brain.discard_session_context). TTL is
per-message: send() resolves it by ADDRESS (broadcast vs directed, config-
tunable) and stamps `expires_at` via the clock contract (iso_now/iso_after);
readers filter `expires_at > now` and the reaper deletes `expires_at <= now`.
