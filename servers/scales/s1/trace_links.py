"""trace↔node links — what S1 surfaced and encoded, joined to traces.

Scale: S1 (turn). This composes S1's OWN behavioral output — S1R surface
selections and S1E encode runs — into a per-trace view of which nodes the brain
touched around each turn. It is the S1 sibling of brain_traces.py's
conversation reads: those compose s0 traces into the conversation; this
composes s1 traces into the node-links over that conversation. Recall lives at
the brain level (it spans every scale); surface+encode are about the turn, so
they live here.

It is a consumer-NEUTRAL link, not "provenance" (which is one reader's lens).
The capability returns, per target trace, the nodes linked to it by relation:

    trace_id -> {
        'surfaced':   [node_id, ...],   # recall surfaced AND Haiku picked (S1R)
        'encoded':    [node_id, ...],   # what the owning run wrote    (S1E)
        'encoded_by': trace_id | None,  # the encoding_run trace; None = unencoded
        'encoded_by_stop': int | None,  # that run's stop — the turn it ran on
        'authored':   [node_id, ...],   # what Anchor's own tools wrote (S0, anchor_touched)
        'created':    [node_id, ...],   # authored, split: nodes Anchor created (S0)
        'revised':    [node_id, ...],   # authored, split: nodes Anchor revised (S0)
        'archived':   [node_id, ...],   # nodes Anchor archived this turn (S0)
        'recalled':   [node_id, ...],   # Anchor's by-id reads, get_node[s] (S0)
        'looked_up':  [node_id, ...],   # Anchor's search results — recall*/find/filter/enrich (S0)
        'endo':       [node_id, ...],   # endo-surfaced this turn (S0, empty until wired)
        'dropped':    [node_id, ...],   # offered to Haiku, NOT picked (S1R pool − surfaced)
        'fetched_by': {node_id: tool},  # tool-fetched, ADMITTED to the pool (S1R tool_trace)
        'floored_by': {node_id: tool},  # tool-fetched, floor-rejected — never pooled
    }

    `created`/`revised`/`archived` are the per-verb split of the same
    anchor_touched delta `authored` merges (`authored` = created ∪ revised, kept
    for the readers that only need "Anchor wrote this here") — the encoder's
    <provenance> renders the verbs, so the split rides the same join.

    `fetched_by`/`floored_by` are the tool-provenance tier (K rows carry
    tool_trace with per-call result_ids/dropped_ids from 2026-07-02; older
    traces simply yield empty dicts). Three label tiers for one node at one
    turn: picked (`surfaced`), pooled-but-not-picked (`dropped`, which
    INCLUDES admitted tool fetches — fetched_by says which tool), and
    fetched-but-floored (`floored_by` only — these never reached Haiku, a
    harder negative than dropped).

Two readers, ONE join (do not fork a sibling join per reader — that is how the
2-vs-3-tuple drift happened):
  • The S1 encoder reads a link as "already handled here → revise, don't dupe,"
    and reads `encoded_by is None` as the emergent unencoded boundary.
  • The LAF episodic layers read the SAME link at similar past moments:
    `surfaced` (+act picked), `encoded` (+act learned), `dropped` (−inhibit —
    offered in a situation like this and consistently not chosen).

THE JOIN IS STRUCTURAL, by stop_counter — never by timestamp proximity. Every
chain for turn N ends in `-N` (`s0-{short}-N`, `s1r-{short}-N`, `s1e-{short}-N`),
so `_stop_of` extracts the join key from any of them. surfaced is 1:1 with a turn
(same stop); encode is per-RUN (one run at stop S closes the turn-range ending
at S), so a turn's owning run is the first run whose stop is STRICTLY greater
than the turn's stop (turn chains stamp pre-increment, run chains post-), and
`encoded_by` disambiguates which run / marks the boundary.

TWO LAYERS so it is robust to a raw trace dataset run sequentially:
  • nodes_for_traces(...) — PURE. Plain trace records in, link map out. No brain,
    no DB. This is what eval replay (Frozen Corpus), unit tests, and any
    historical/sequential dataset drive directly; it assumes nothing about storage.
  • gather(brain, session_id, streams=...) — thin live adapter. Pulls the named
    trace streams via the public `query_traces` door (no bespoke DAL) and returns
    a DICT keyed by stream name — never a bare tuple (tuple arity is unauditable
    drift; a named dict extends without breaking any consumer). Eval/tests skip it.

Anchor's own actions (`authored`/`recalled`) come from the S0 `anchor_touched`
delta — a per-turn aggregate the daemon flushes at the Stop boundary (the S0
mirror of the S1 encode delta). It reuses the encode delta's `created`/`revised`
keys, so `_delta_ids` parses both with no second path. NOT sourced from
`encoding_source` (in-flux, encoder-invisible) — the touched delta is captured
structurally at dispatch, where only Anchor's TCP calls flow. `endo` rides the
same delta when endo recall is wired.

    """Live adapter: fetch named trace streams for a session. Thin.

    Composes the public `query_traces` door (no bespoke DAL, per the §10.2
    trace-query law). Returns {stream_name: [trace records]} for the requested
    `streams` — a NAMED dict, never a bare tuple: tuple arity drifts silently
    when two consumers evolve the stream list apart (the 2-vs-3-tuple lesson);
    a keyed dict extends without breaking anyone. Eval/tests bypass this and
    feed records to nodes_for_traces directly.

    Defaults to the encoder's three streams. The episodic layers pass
    ('surface', 'encode', 'recall') — `recall` is the Δ `additionalContext`
    candidate-pool rows carrying `metadata.outcomes_per_candidate` (the
    authoritative Haiku-resolved pool + verdict; `_candidate_outcomes` also
    reads the O `recall` raw-pool shape for datasets that only logged that).

    `limit` is the session trace-pull bound (created_at DESC, so it keeps the
    most-recent traces — what the recent-turn window needs). Distinct from the
    timeline's LIVED_SEQUENCE_PULL; a reusable adapter default, not a per-piece
    constant. A consumer with a different need passes its own.

    `older_than` (ISO, strict `created_at <`) is the replay as-of bound —
    pushed through query_traces into SQL so the DESC LIMIT window sits at
    that instant. A Python post-filter here would clip exactly the rows a
    deep-history replay needs (the fetch-then-filter class).
