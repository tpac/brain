    `selected_ids` is what the stream SAW — the seeds the render delivered.

    list and pool dedup, co-access, LAF's surfaced role, the time tool's
    'discussed' anchor, the S2 decoders) means exactly that, so it is the
    fact recorded there. Haiku's decision stays auditable alongside:
    `picked` (its resolved picks before any gate), `not_shown` (every pick
    that did not render, with its reason: unresolvable, archived_no_survivor,
    veil_unavailable, walled, already_shown, no_node, budget), `redirected`
    (archived pick → survivor that rendered instead) and `also_lit`
    (neighbors shown as one title line — in context by title only, so NOT
    part of `selected`). The Δ trace's selection fields stay the picker's
    verdict over its menu (built from `picked`).

    `expansion` carries activation data from spread_activation when present —
    we attach per-node activation values and the kernel's per-hop trace to
    the K-event metadata so dashboards / S3 can see which nodes lit up and
    by how much, not just which were surfaced.

    `telemetry` is the run-cost dict from _call_surface (build_run_telemetry
    kwargs). It's emitted FLAT into the K-event metadata via build_run_telemetry
    — the same shared cost block the encoder delta carries — so Surface's
    input/output tokens + cache + elapsed_ms are queryable from traces, closing
    the long-standing surface cost-telemetry gap. Guarded by
    check_surface_telemetry so it can't silently regress to zeros.

    `pt` (optional PhaseTimer): when supplied, its per-phase breakdown is
    snapshotted into the K trace as `phase_timing` — the structured, queryable
    form of the hook_phase_timing debug string. The K trace also records an
    `outcome` flag (served / empty) so a turn that surfaced nothing is
    distinguishable from one that did, without cross-referencing other logs.

    `selection_reason` (Haiku's recall-level rationale, in practice the
    why-nothing-was-picked note) is the S1Surface journal on the K event —
    the trace is its only durable home; it is never rendered to Anchor.
