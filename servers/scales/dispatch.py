"""Scale dispatch infrastructure — env loading + the write-command classification.

Shared by all scale agents (S1 Scribe, the S2 units, future scales). Both now
run IN-PROCESS on the daemon's brain and write through
`scales/s2/base.py::_make_encoder_dispatch`, which calls COMMAND_TABLE handlers
directly under `brain.write_lock` (the same lock daemon_server.py uses for
client requests, so cross-writer serialization is guaranteed).

This module no longer holds a dispatch factory. The legacy out-of-process path
— a background-thread `Brain(skip_embedder=True)` copy writing back over TCP via
`daemon_tcp_send` + `make_scale_dispatch` — was retired when S1 Scribe converged
onto the in-process pattern (S1 was its last user). What remains: `load_env` and
the canonical write-command CLASSIFICATION the attribution chokepoint reads.

# ── Provider failure classification (the LLM seam) ──
#
# The brain reacts to a REFUSED call — pause encoding on a dead key, park until
# a quota window reopens — and those reactions must not know WHICH provider
# refused. This maps one provider's exception onto a closed vocabulary; adding a
# second provider means adding a second mapper here, never a branch at the
# reaction site. Key resolution already lives in this module, so interpreting
# the refusal of the key we resolved belongs beside it.
#
# Status code first, exception class second, deliberately: HTTP semantics port
# across providers, `anthropic.AuthenticationError` does not. Nothing here
# imports an SDK — the classifier is provider-neutral by construction, and the
# test suite can exercise every branch without one.
