"""S2 Community Detection — orchestrator.

Wires CommunityDecoder (algorithmic) → rejection filter → CommunityEncoder.
This file is the public API — callers import CommunityDetection from here.

Decoder: servers/scales/s2/community_decoder.py
Encoder: servers/scales/s2/community_encoder.py
Rejection suppression: servers/scales/s2/rejection_table.py
Contract: servers/scales/s2/community_contract.py
Prompt: s2_community_enrichment interaction (v12+)

Phase 1 idle gate (2026-05-29): the decode is a pure function of graph state,
so re-running it on an unchanged graph re-derives identical, already-rejected
proposals. The gate skips the whole unit unless the graph changed since the
last decode AND a minimum interval elapsed — turning a ~15s full-graph scan
that fired every idle cycle (87% doing zero work) into a cheap no-op when
nothing has changed.
