# ── S0 TURN CLASSIFICATION ──
# Every stop produces one S0 turn, classified by its incoming-side (s0,"K")
# ref_type. NOT every turn is a conversation worth encoding. This is the single
# source of truth for "what's filtered and what's not" — consumers read these
# constants instead of re-deciding inline.
#
#   incoming ref_type   what it is                                conversational?
#   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   user_message        real operator prompt (hook_recall ran;     YES
#                        last_user_activity reset this turn)
#   self_message        inbound msg from another stream            no  (planned)
#                        (anchor↔anchor)
#   thalamus_delivery   the brain's own due items rendered into    no  (planned)
#                        this session (channels/delivery.py)
#   heartbeat           /watch wakeup re-arm, no real input        no  (never)
#                        (no prompt + empty inbox)
#
# The dial governs TWO things, both timeline-side:
#   (a) the encoder's conversation window — get_session_turns selects
#       CONVERSATIONAL_REF_TYPES, derived below, so a True row's turns enter
#       the timeline as their own incoming side (the trace's metadata.content
#       carries the delivered block; channels/delivery.py stamps it);
#   (b) reaction classification — the stop right after a delivery-block
#       (post_response_common's delivery-continuation branch) records the
#       response as a real assistant_message iff any delivered ref_type is
#       True here; otherwise it stays a heartbeat. Flipping a row therefore
#       makes the incoming message AND the reaction appear together.
# The dial does NOT govern the S1 Scribe's CADENCE: turns_since_last_encode
# counts s0 user_message rows only (dal_logs.conversational_turns_since,
# hardcoded ref_type), so a flipped correspondent enters the conversation
# cleanly without ticking encode cadence. Cadence is also distinct from
# stop_counter, the per-stop SEQUENCE number that advances on EVERY stop
# (incl. heartbeats) so chain IDs stay unique. Non-conversational turns are
# still written to S0 (for observability) but never drive or feed encoding.
#
# anchor↔anchor and brain↔anchor encoding are PLANNED capabilities, switched
# OFF until the encoder prompt is taught the correspondent elements. The
# single dial per correspondent is below. heartbeat stays False forever.

# DERIVED from S0_CONVERSATIONAL_INCOMING so there is exactly one dial. This

# switch model mid-session), so they live on the SessionContext and are
# stamped by the S0 write door (brain_traces.stamp_s0_session) from the ctx
# the daemon resolved. Fed in by the UserPromptSubmit / Stop hooks
# (hook_common.turn_model / host_tells): Codex puts `model` on every hook
# payload; Claude Code exposes it only in the transcript's assistant entries.
