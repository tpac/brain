    Production leaves BRAIN_TMP_DIR unset → /tmp. The seam is wired on BOTH
    sides for the production path: the daemon WRITES via this helper, and the
    out-of-process READERS honor the same env protocol — the PostToolUse hook
    (hooks/scripts/post_tool_trace.py, current-stop) and the dashboard
    (dashboard/queries/recalls.py judge-result, dashboard/server.py
    consolidation-prompt). Those readers are deliberately servers-decoupled, so
    they read os.environ.get('BRAIN_TMP_DIR','/tmp') directly rather than import
    this — keep them in sync if the default ever changes.

    BrainTestBase + IsolatedBrain set it to a per-test/run temp dir so two
    concurrent test processes don't collide on fixed filenames (hardcoded
    session_ids, fixed encoder-prompt counters) and the files are cleaned up
    with the temp dir instead of leaking into /tmp.

    The EVAL path is wired the same way: the longmem harness sets BRAIN_TMP_DIR
    to the per-item brain dir at a single seam (fresh_brain.create_fresh_eval_brain,
    alongside BRAIN_DB_DIR — every brain-building harness funnels through it),
    and the eval/script glob readers honor the same env protocol (inline
    os.environ.get, or this helper where the module already imports servers).
    To enumerate the readers, grep 'BRAIN_TMP_DIR' and 'brain_tmp_dir' across
    eval/ and scripts/ — they are NOT listed here because a hand-maintained
    inventory rots (this docstring already did once). So concurrent eval runs
    are isolated: each item's ephemeral dumps land in its own dir and readers
    never cross-copy another run's files.

    those are the well-known uid-keyed rendezvous hooks and the statusline must
