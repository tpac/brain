# the USER's client config and never ships with the plugin — so we can't rely on
# it to keep the brain's core tools loaded. Instead we mark them at the source:

# reaches every installer's Claude Code; older clients ignore the unknown key
# harmlessly. There is no `alwaysLoad: false` — anything NOT listed here defers
