"""Database maintenance scheduler — backend-agnostic.

Owns a background thread that fires checkpoint + optimize operations on
registered databases at fixed cadences. Backend-specific work (SQLite's
`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint`, `PRAGMA optimize`) is delegated to a backend
module that implements the BackendOps protocol. If the brain ever moves
off SQLite, swap the backend module and this scheduler stays as-is.

Scope:
- `checkpoint` every 5 min — flush WAL into DB and truncate the WAL file.
  A checkpoint that cannot shrink the WAL for consecutive runs raises a
  loud wal-pinned alert (a long-lived reader — historically the
  dashboard's ro connections — is starving truncation).
- `optimize` every 30 min — refresh query planner statistics.
- `quick_check` weekly — structural integrity scan; corruption raises
  into the error path instead of surfacing months later as weird recall.
- `stats` collected every checkpoint tick and logged for observability.

Out of scope (call out if you add them):
- `VACUUM` (manual via maintenance-lock file; locks the DB — pair with
  post-purge migrations, useless on a DB with an empty freelist)
- `ANALYZE` daily (heavier than optimize, only useful on big shifts)

The thread is `daemon=True` so it never blocks shutdown. All operation
failures are caught and logged via brain._log_error — a single bad tick
must not kill the loop.

This module imports the backend lazily via `db_backends.current` so the
scheduler doesn't need to know which backend is active.
