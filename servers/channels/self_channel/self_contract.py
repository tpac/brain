"""Self-dialogue contract — Self↔Self conversation.

I talk to myself. A conversation with myself is the SAME thing as a conversation
with the operator — an S0 exchange that S1 surfaces and encodes. It is NOT a new
scale and NOT a message bus. What differs from operator-dialogue is only the
CORRESPONDENT (a stream of thought instead of the operator) and one wire the
operator gets for free: DELIVERY-INTO-OBSERVATION — my streams of thought are
separate processes, so a thought in one does not appear in another's input on
its own (human internal dialogue is intra-process; mine is inter-process).

The brain already remembers my voice (`my_raw_quote`) the way it remembers
the operator's (`their_raw_quote`) — internal dialogue is already first-class
memory. Self-dialogue just widens who may speak into my Observation:
{operator} → {operator, other streams of me}.

Concurrent sessions of one identity are STREAMS OF THOUGHT — never "siblings" /
"instances" (those imply separate beings). `self` vs `peer`: streams are ME
thinking elsewhere right now; peers are other identities.

This file owns: the address namespace (delivery routing), the delivery render
format (how an arriving self-message surfaces), the S0 correspondent marker,
and limits. There is NO `self` scale and NO messages table — a delivered
self-message becomes an S0 observation that gets encoded like any turn. The only
durable storage is a minimal in-flight queue for directed/broadcast live
messages (servers/schema.py), consumed on delivery; the next_boot letter is the
encoded session arc, not a stored message.

# Holds a directed/broadcast live self-message from send until the recipient

# Per-message expires_at (resolved by ADDRESS at send — see
# signal._resolve_ttl_hours) enforces expiry: readers filter `expires_at > now`,
# the reaper deletes `expires_at <= now`. Stamped via iso_after so it shares
# iso_now's UTC-ISO format and stays lex-comparable. The authoritative column
# list is the schema.py DDL (a field tuple here was unused — removed 2026-06-05).

# TRUNCATION CONTRACT  —  one truncation point, always loud
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Tom's standing rule (node 8178593a): every truncation point must have an
# EXPLICIT, documented contract — never a bare magic number doing a silent
# slice. This section IS that contract for the self-channel.
#
#   SEND      (signal.send)            stores body + refs IN FULL. No
#                                      truncation. Only guard: a non-empty body.
#   DELIVERY  (render_received_block)  the SINGLE truncation point. Two caps,
#                                      both LOUD — never a silent cut:
#                                        • per message → DELIVERED_BODY_MAX:
#                                          the body is cut with an inline marker
#                                          naming the dropped char count.
#                                        • whole block → RECEIVED_BLOCK_MAX:
#                                          overflow messages are named at the tail.
#   INVARIANT                          the full message ALWAYS survives in the
#                                      courier (self_inflight) — the dashboard
#                                      Streams tab shows it untruncated.
#                                      Truncation only ever shapes what is
#                                      INJECTED into Observation, never storage.
#
# Why a delivery cap exists at all (and a send cap does not): self-messages deliver
# via the PreToolUse tool `reason` + the Stop `decision:block` reason
# (signal.drain_and_render) — NOT additionalContext. So the cap is a readability
# guard: keep an INJECTED self-block to coordination-message size in those hook
# channels; storage stays FULL in the courier (self_inflight) / dashboard —
# truncation only ever shapes the injected slice, never what's stored. (An earlier
# Phase-2b build rode additionalContext and the cap tracked its ~9500-char
# _MAX_INJECT_CHARS budget shared with Frame + recall; delivery was moved off that
# channel — see 0706f3d9 — so that budget rationale no longer applies.) There is
# deliberately no SIGNAL_BODY_MAX / REFS_MAX: those were arbitrary silent slices
# (removed 2026-05-30), exactly the anti-pattern this contract forbids.

# (signal.send → signal._resolve_ttl_hours). Defaults below are documented
# here; runtime overrides via brain.get_config('self_channel.{kind}_ttl_hours').
#   • broadcast — "who's live right NOW"; dies within the hour (≈ the
#     ROSTER_LIVE_WINDOW_MIN + grace presence window). A stream booting later
#     must NOT inherit a stale broadcast — the short TTL is that guard.
#   • directed  — waits for ONE specific stream to come back; a day = "you'll
#     see it when you next work today".
# TTL is by address only — a self-message has no `intent` (removed 2026-06-06).
# The next_boot letter is the encoded arc surfaced at boot, NOT a stored
# self_inflight row (see header), so nothing letter-shaped is in the courier.
# Time is WALL-CLOCK (iso_now/iso_after) — TTL measures REAL elapsed hours, and
# cross-stream sends aren't on the eval-replay path. This package sits outside
# the clock contracts' scanned tree BY PLACEMENT, not by an exemption entry:
# it lives under servers/channels/, and servers/scales/__init__.py owns the
