"""Delivery — the last mile: every channel that touches a live stream rides this.

One owner for the leg: at a delivery MOMENT, walk the SOURCES, skip the
ineligible, render each failure-isolated, keep the blocks, trace each shown
delivery as an s0 K event on the receiving session's chain, and join. The
channel packages own storage and policy (courier: consume-once + TTL;
Thalamus: queue + ledger + windows); this module owns only the leg, so both
hooks call it instead of composing sources themselves.

Eligibility is a ruling as a predicate (operator rulings id:7c7e805c,
id:bb0513ae): a source speaks at a moment iff the moment FORCES a read or
the source SURVIVES A MISS. The courier declines the passive boot moment —
a consumed message that goes unread leaves only a `self_delivered` row and
silence — while a Thalamus item stays open after a missed render and an
unanswered ask expires loudly, so it can ride any moment.

MOMENT VOCABULARY lives here (thalamus_contract derives its names from
these). Sources import their channel packages CALL-TIME inside the render
adapters: thalamus_contract imports this module at load for the moment
names, so a load-time import back into `channels/` would close the cycle.
The per-source trace ref_types come from modules OUTSIDE channels/
(trace_contract, self_contract), keeping their import-time contract guards.

The caller owns the chain: `deliver` takes the receiving session's
SessionContext and stamps every trace with its s0 chain — the same
symmetric record at boot and Stop, which is what makes a delivery joinable
to the rest of the session's S0 stream.
