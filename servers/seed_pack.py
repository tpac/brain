"""The Nursery's seed pack — the founding memories every fresh brain is born with.

Why this exists
===============
The brain is agentic: the encoder, recall, consolidation, community detection,
and the healer all pattern-match against existing nodes. A fresh brain with zero
nodes gives those agents no priors — their first decisions are blind, and every
subsequent encoding compounds the blind start. The pack is also the entity's
identity floor: who it is, how its body and growth work, and the reflexes that
make experience accumulate correctly from turn one.

Design principles (ratified 2026-08-30, D-5)
============================================
- Instincts, not memories — no false autobiography. Worked examples carry
  `exemplar: True` and say so in prose. The one true story is the pack's own
  origin, which names its makers (Tom and Anchor — the tribute sites are
  seed_community, silent_failure_lesson, decision_shape_exemplar; the four
  locked nodes stay name-free).
- Editable identity — exactly 4 locked nodes (the safety core); everything
  else is the entity's to revise. Six `developmental: True` scaffolds are
  DESIGNED to be revised away: framing stays, the generic verdict fades on
  evidence (never dates), each carries a self-run test and a coasting flag.
- Placement — seeds carry renegotiable instincts; tool signatures and paths
  that drift with releases stay in code-owned docs, seeds point at them.
- Name-free — no node asserts the entity's name; the name lives in config
  (BRAIN_AGENT_NAME) and the spoken boot. No interpolation happens here.
- Register sets the future — the pack is the encoder's only early catalog,
  so every node models the shape it teaches: when-trigger situations,
  as-asked questions, honest signed emotion, edges with real whys.
- Types and relations come from registered aspect families only
  (aspects_v1.json) — the pack must not teach the encoder unrouted labels.

Structure
=========
26 nodes: 4 identity core (LOCKED) · 6 self-knowledge · 6 growth reflexes ·
3 encoder curriculum · 1 seed community · 6 developmental scaffolds.
SEED_EDGES holds the 25 semantic edges; the loader additionally generates
community_member edges (seed_community → every other node) and writes the
community_members / community_size metadata the membership reconciler treats
as its orphan-recovery seed.

Loader contract
===============
- Generation guard: SEED_PACK_GENERATION is stamped in brain_meta at first
  seed. Gap-fill (crash recovery) runs only when the marker matches; a
  marker-less brain with seed nodes is a previous-generation install and is
  left untouched — the Nursery raises newborns, it never re-seeds grown
  brains.
- Re-seeding is idempotent by title: exact-title match first (deterministic),
  embedding fuzzy match second (catches organic near-equivalents).
- Node dicts pass to brain.remember() minus `slug`; `exemplar` /
  `developmental` ride **extra_fields into node_metadata_kv.
- The Zero-Memory boot block (brain_voice) is the pack's spoken half — it
  fires while the brain is younger than ZERO_MEMORY_MIN_DAYS or has fewer
  than ZERO_MEMORY_MIN_LIVED non-seed memories, then retires itself.
