"""Database backup policy — the ONE owner of every backup the brain takes.

Backend-agnostic. The consistent-snapshot mechanism (online backup API +
gzip) lives in the active db_backend (`snapshot_to` / `backup_snapshot`);
this module owns the backend-independent policy: destination naming,
listing/parsing the backup set, which snapshots to keep (GFS retention),
and the two pre-destructive-operation entry points every destructive
caller routes through:

- `backup_before_destructive(db_path, tag)` — a named, durable
  `{db}.{tag}.bak.gz` taken immediately before a specific rewrite
  (schema migration, table rebuild, destructive script). Idempotent per
  tag so a retried operation doesn't overwrite the pre-first-attempt
  state.
- `ensure_backup_fresh(db_path)` — the freshness gate for automatic
  destructive maintenance (idle sweeps): guarantees a destructive op
  never runs more than `max_age_s` away from a restorable rolling
  snapshot, snapshotting first when the newest one is stale.

The AUTOMATIC rolling backups (`backup_database`, daily scheduler) write
`{basename}.{timestamp}.gz` into the backup dir; retention only ever
touches files matching that scheme, so tagged `.bak.gz` files and
hand-made `.bak*` files are never listed, kept, or pruned by it.

Retention is GFS:
- `keep_daily`   — newest snapshot of each of the most recent N days
- `keep_weekly`  — newest snapshot of each of the most recent N ISO weeks
- `keep_monthly` — newest snapshot of each of the most recent N months
A snapshot survives if any tier selects it (union). At daily cadence this
holds ~keep_daily + keep_weekly + keep_monthly files at steady state.

Tagged `.bak[.gz]` files get TTL retention instead of GFS: a
pre-destructive backup is a verification net, not an archive — its value
decays with time since the operation it guarded, not with snapshot
density (an unreaped one measured 888MB). `reap_by_ttl` is the generic
age-gated primitive for EXPLICIT, scoped invocations — it is deliberately
not wired into the rotation, because the tagged corpus has readers (the
recovery scripts glob `brain.db.*.bak[.gz]` as their data source).
