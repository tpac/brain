"""LAF v1 recall variant — the flag-gated challenger scorer (§19 P1).

Activated by BRAIN_RECALL_VARIANT=laf_v1 (exported from hooks/scripts/brain-env.sh,
sourced by brain-daemon). Flag off → this module is never imported and the champion
path in brain_recall._recall_impl runs unchanged. Rollback = unset the flag + restart.

The composition (measured on the 24-cue lens-independent gold, eval/laf/composition_probe.py
+ maxsim_decomp.py — 18% need@5 / 28% need@25 vs production ~10% need@5):

    score(n) = sigmoid( Σ_field gain_field · z(field(n)) )

The FIELD REGISTRY (LafV1Engine._fields) is the extension seam: adding a lane = one
registry entry + a 'gain_<name>' config key. v1 fields:

    maxsim — best raw cosine(query, node) across the 6 embedding views (nanmax; the
             decomposed sum(z)/max(z) variants measured worse IN-STACK at static gains —
             they become fitted columns at P3, see eval/laf/maxsim_decomp.md)
    pick   — nodes Haiku surfaced AND selected at past moments similar to the query
             (uncapped full-history trace scan — the newest-500 recall_episodes cap is
             deliberately NOT inherited; Tom 2026-07-02: structurally wrong for a field)
    enc    — nodes created/revised at similar past moments
    idf    — production's idf2 rare-token title boost re-expressed as a lane
    sit    — cosine(query, node _situation vector) as its own lane (NOT folded into
             maxsim's nanmax: separate gain so P4 can re-cue it from situation state)

Gains resolve through ONE seam (LafV1Engine.config: module defaults ⊕ the interactions
K-store entry 'recall_laf', TTL-cached) — P3 fits the values, P4 swaps the resolver to
g(query); the runtime shape here never changes for that.

RANGE CONTRACT: scores() returns values in the OPEN interval (0,1) — brain_recall's
champion machinery (fatigue multiply, noise/relevance floors, critical boost) assumes
cosine-like magnitudes. The sigmoid guarantees it mathematically; scores() validates
finiteness and raises rather than ship an out-of-contract vector (the caller's
try/except falls back to champion and logs).

PER-QUERY TELEMETRY: scores() also returns a compact per-field z-score record for the
top-scoring nodes ({node_id: {field: z}}); brain_recall attaches it to the result as
`_laf_fields` so the S1R trace substrate accretes (query, per-field scores, outcome)
rows in production — the P2 dataset walker's training feed.

Known accepted gap (code-review 2026-07-02, finding 10): a node with NO embedding rows
is invisible to the field; under the flag it is reachable only via the champion's
keyword fallback (which still runs), not the FTS5 stem net (gated off). The class is
narrow and transient (vector backfill closes it); lexical returns via the P4 gate.

AS_OF (§20.11 read-side time travel): scores(..., as_of=<ISO ts>) scores the
query against corpus state at that instant — masks, not copies. Caches stay
current-state supersets; as_of builds per-call boolean row masks from two
creation-date arrays (node rows / trace rows). The node mask applies ONCE, in
the z-score registry loop, so every node-indexed lane — including future ones —
inherits time travel for free; the trace mask applies at the shared episodic
door (roles_for_moments) plus the moment-similarity line. as_of=None builds no
masks and is the identical code path (inert by construction, pinned by tests).

Caches (daemon-resident, staleness-checked per call, lock-guarded):
  field matrices  growable [N×768] per view — INCREMENTAL rowid-watermark upserts via
                  VectorDAL.vectors_since; full rebuild only on deletion (count shrink)
  node created    row-aligned created_at array (the as_of node-mask ingredient)
  title idf       full rebuild, but only when nodes' change_key moved AND a TTL expired
                  (+ per-token sorted creation timestamps — the walker's as-of df
                  invention moved into the cache)
  trace matrix    block list (no per-append copy), incremental by created_at
                  (+ parallel created_at list — the as_of trace-mask ingredient)
  config          TTL-cached K-store overlay
