"""Recent sessions — the one place a session_id becomes something readable.

A session is a stream of thought working somewhere. The brain already persists
where: `SessionContext.save()` writes cwd / branch / worktree / project into
`session_state` under the `_session_context` key. This module joins that to the
trace counts so every session_id the dashboard shows can carry a human handle
and a hover with enough to find the thing again.

Identity convention (matched to the Streams tab and the brain's own
"one stream, one worktree — your handle is your branch name"): the handle is
the worktree name, else the branch tail with the shared `claude/` namespace
dropped, else the 8-char hex. Never invented — if the brain never learned
where a session was working, its handle stays the hex, honestly.

    The limit is generous (80) because this feeds a REGISTRY, not a dropdown:

    tab's 48h encode window routinely spans more streams than a picker-sized
    list would cover — a session past the cut renders as raw hex.

    `worktree`, `project`, `cwd`) and its accumulated `arc` line. The frontend
