"""S1 recall events — the live decoding feed.

Reads from `trace_events` (single source of truth since 2026-04-05): joins
O / K / delta rows by chain_id to produce one summary per recall.

Cursor is timestamp-based (`since_ts`), not integer rowid: `trace_events.id`
is now an 8-char hex string under schema v29, so integer ordering no longer
applies. `created_at` is monotonic per writer.
