Surfaces identity (`human_identity` / `agent_identity`) and the S0 session
stamp (`model` / `host`) from trace metadata as top-level fields so the UI
doesn't have to re-parse JSON: every trace records who was speaking when it was
written, and S0 rows record which model produced the turn on which host.
