"""Runtime-signal insights for the Live tab's top panel.

Distinct from queries/stats.py:query_insights() (which surfaces
DATA-quality issues for the Health tab — orphan-locked, thin nodes,
zero quotes). This module flags BEHAVIORAL anomalies the operator
should see in real time:

  - S2 units that haven't fired in a while
  - Surface judge selecting nothing too often (recall pipeline drift)
  - Error count spiking over the prior-hour baseline

Pure derived analysis — no new tables, no daemon round-trips. Reads
trace_events + error_logs via @safe_query. Returns a list of
{severity, icon, title, detail, evidence} dicts ready for the
frontend to render as cards.

Severity ladder: 'low' / 'medium' / 'high'. The frontend maps these
to color + icon weight; rules below pick severity based on how far
the signal has drifted from baseline.
