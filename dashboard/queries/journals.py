"""Encoder journals — the one reader for `journal_note` traces, all scales.

Every journaling encoder (S1 Scribe + the four S2 units) writes the SAME shape
through `brain.write_journal_notes`: one trace row per note, `event_type='delta'`,
`ref_type='journal_note'`, subject in `ref_id`, `{note, tag}` in metadata. This
module is the single dashboard-side reader of that shape.

Two doors, one row formatter:

  * `notes_by_chain(conn, chain_ids)` — takes an ALREADY-OPEN logs_db conn, for
    callers enriching run cards (queries.encoding, queries.s2_runs) that are
    mid-query and must not open a second connection.
  * `query_journal_notes(...)` — owns its own connection, for the standalone
    Journals view and the per-card peek.

Before this module there were three readers for the same rows: encoding.py had
its own inline journal SQL for S1E, s2_runs.py showed consolidation a legacy
`final_text` blob, and healer/community/aspects showed nothing at all. Adding a
sixth encoder used to mean a fourth reader; now it means zero.

# Note prose is capped at JOURNAL_NOTE_LIMIT (600) server-side; no second cap
# here — a note is already terse by contract, and re-truncating for display
# would hide the tail of exactly the notes worth reading.

# ── Tag normalization (the read-time tolerance the write side assumes) ──
# `tag` is the grouping key, contracted as one word. But the READ side renders
# a persisting item's head as `open ×3 since 08-17 · subject · note`
# (render_journal_notes_prefix), and trace_contract deliberately lets encoders
# echo that head back rather than spending prompt budget teaching them not to —
# "a tolerant reader costs nothing". `resolve_target` supplies that tolerance
# for the subject field; nothing did for the tag, so live data carries 25
# variants of `open` and the grouping key groups nothing.
#
# Splitting it here is both the fix and a free signal: ×N and the since-date
# are the escalation data (JOURNAL_OPEN_NUDGE_RUNS = 5), so the view can rank
# by how long something has been open without a second source.

    silently disagreed with the summary's window-wide counts (measured:
    tag=doubt returned 1/3/5 notes at limit 20/100/400, while unit=healer

    `unit` filters on the encoder (s1e / consolidation / community_detection /

    ref_id (the subject is free text — a node id, a cluster label, a tool
    name — so exact match would be useless).

    `tag` matches the NORMALIZED tag: the stored value may carry a lifecycle
    suffix (`open ×3 since 08-17`, see split_tag), so an exact comparison
    would miss most `open` rows and a bare LIKE prefix would fold `still-open`
