"""Aspect taxonomy — reads the aspects + member counts from the live brain.

`aspects_v1.json` is the single source of truth (servers/scales/s2/aspects_v1.json
in the repo as a seed; the live working copy lives at $BRAIN_DB_DIR/aspects_v1.json
per the edee19c migration). Each aspect declares `node_types` and
`edge_relations` it claims; this query counts how many active nodes/edges
fall into each aspect against brain.db.

We deliberately re-read the JSON each call rather than caching — it's tiny
(~5 KB) and the encoder rewrites it when AspectIntegration runs. Caching
would mean stale counts on the dashboard.

    Architectural note (deliberate exception to the disconnection contract):
    this walks `../../servers/scales/s2/aspects_v1.json` — a path-level
    reach into the brain repo that `test_dashboard_disconnection` cannot
    catch because it scans imports, not filesystem paths.

    Why it's allowed:
      * The dashboard reads ONLY — it never writes the file.
      * Tom's principle: "Dashboard inspects existing data — never changes
        core behavior to serve display" (memory id:818febd7). The aspect
        taxonomy IS existing data: the brain already reads this exact JSON
        as its config. The dashboard reading the same JSON is consuming
        the SAME single source of truth, not creating a parallel funnel.
      * The alternative — adding a `get_aspects` daemon TCP command — WOULD
        be a core change, exactly the pattern Tom's principle forbids.

    Disposition:
      * On a healthy brain the user-dir copy exists and this path is
        never read (the live config is the single source of truth).
      * On a fresh brain (no user-dir copy yet) this seed path is the
        single source of truth — the same file the brain itself bootstraps
        from. Reading it here mirrors that bootstrap.
      * If the path ever becomes wrong (brain moves the seed), the symptom
        is "(no aspects loaded)" in the UI — degrades gracefully.
