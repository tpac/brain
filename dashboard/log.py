"""Single stderr logger + in-memory error ring for the dashboard.

The dashboard intentionally degrades gracefully when something goes wrong —
half the panels would crash the page if any one query raised, so each query
catches its own exceptions and returns an empty result. The historic pattern
was `except Exception: pass / return []` which made every failure invisible.

This module does two things:

1. **Loud stderr logging** — `warn(component, message, exc=)` prints to
   stderr in a uniform format. The preview console + a shell-launched
   dashboard both see it; failures stop being silent.

2. **In-memory ring buffer** — every warn() also appends to a bounded deque
   the `/api/dashboard-errors` route exposes. This makes the dashboard
   self-monitoring: when something goes wrong, you can see it in the
   Logs tab (Dashboard sub-feed) without tailing terminal output.

Loud-by-default principle: a silent failure is worse than a noisy one.
The ring buffer makes "noisy" cheap — it doesn't fill disk, it doesn't
spam every console; it just sits there waiting to be looked at when a
panel shows blank.
