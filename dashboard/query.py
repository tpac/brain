"""@safe_query — eliminate the ~50 copies of the same try/except/return-[] shape.

Before this module, every query function in dashboard/queries/* looked like:

    def query_X(...):
        with ro_connect(some_db_path()) as conn:
            if conn is None:
                return []
            try:
                rows = conn.execute(SQL, params).fetchall()
                return [shape(r) for r in rows]
            except Exception as e:
                warn('queries.X', '... failed', exc=e)
                return []

Three things repeated: the ro_connect/conn-is-None guard, the try/except
shape, and the warn(component, msg, exc=) call. With this decorator, the
above collapses to:

    @safe_query('queries.X', logs_db_path, default=[])
    def query_X(conn, ...):
        rows = conn.execute(SQL, params).fetchall()
        return [shape(r) for r in rows]

The decorator:
  - Opens the read-only SQLite connection
  - If the DB file is missing OR the open failed → returns `default` quietly
  - If the wrapped function raises → logs via warn() AND returns `default`
  - Otherwise returns the function's value

This intentionally preserves graceful degradation (the dashboard never
crashes a panel because one query failed), but makes every failure visible
in stderr — loud-by-default discipline applied at the substrate.

Why this isn't a context manager:
  - Most query functions take args beyond `conn`; a decorator gives clean
    `query_X(arg1, arg2)` signatures while still owning lifecycle.
  - One function = one boundary of concern; this is what `@` is for.

The `db_path_fn` argument is a CALLABLE returning the path, not the path
itself, so $BRAIN_DB_DIR changes between import time and call time are
honored (eval brain harnesses repoint the dir per test).
