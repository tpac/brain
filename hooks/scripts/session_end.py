"""SessionEnd — session synthesis + consolidation.
Thin client: sends hook_session_end to daemon, falls back to direct Python.

Does NOT shut the daemon down. The daemon is shared across all concurrent
sessions for this user and is launchd-managed (KeepAlive). Ending one session
must not tear it down under the others — doing so killed in-flight recalls in
sibling sessions (closed-DB / empty-reply / connection-reset) and forced the
next recall onto a cold, slow daemon. Lifecycle is owned by launchd + the
4h idle-timeout + the maintenance lock, not by per-session hooks. (Root cause
of the daemon restart-churn diagnosed 2026-06-06; was a stale assumption from
the original single-session daemon consolidation, cf4d140.)
