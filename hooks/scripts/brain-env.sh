# brain — shared environment setup, sourced by every hook .sh
# POSIX sh — sourced (never executed), so it runs in the consumer's shell:
# bash hooks, zsh, dash (/bin/sh on Linux). Keep bashism-free
# (TestResolverChainPortability).
#
# After sourcing:
#   $PLUGIN_DIR    resolves to plugin root
#   $BRAIN_PYTHON  points to the venv's python (the ONLY python hooks use)
#   $BRAIN_PYTHON_DAEMON / _DASH / _HOOK
#                  the same interpreter under a role name (see brain_python_as)
#   $PATH          has $PLUGIN_DIR/venv/bin prepended so `python3` resolves there too
#
# First invocation triggers ensure-runtime.sh (blocks ~60-90s on fresh install).
# Subsequent invocations are instant — just PATH + env var wiring.
# BRAIN_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_WAIT_S is consumed by mcp-launch.sh before sourcing us:
# the host manifest may extend its cold-start wait (default 25s; Codex 300s).
# Keep the host startup timeout larger to leave time for MCP initialization.

# Resolve plugin dir from whichever .sh sourced us.
# ${BASH_SOURCE:-$0}, NOT ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}: the subscripted form resolves to
# the CWD under zsh and is a fatal "Bad substitution" under dash, so a sourcer
# in either shell silently loaded the wrong tree — or died. Bare $BASH_SOURCE
# is element 0 in bash, and $0 is the correct fallback everywhere else.
# resolve-brain-db.sh carries the same idiom for the same reason.

# path (@executable_path/../lib, relative to the link's own directory) while
# the kernel reports the role. Names stay within 15 chars — the Linux comm
# limit (macOS shows 16). Per-session roles carry the session id's first 4
# hex chars, the short prefix self_presence shows:

#   brain_python_as Entity-mcp "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"  → venv/bin/Entity-mcp-3207

# Degrades to $BRAIN_PYTHON (still runs, just named python3.11) whenever the
# link cannot be made — a naming failure must never take a launcher down.
