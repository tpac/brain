"""Self-channel live poller — the event source for /watch-live.

Polls THIS session's self-inbox via the daemon (read-only peek, never consumes)
and prints one stdout line per NEW message. Run under the Monitor tool: each
printed line becomes a notification that ignites the watching window within
~the poll interval, instead of plain /watch's 60s ScheduleWakeup floor.

Design notes:
- PEEK, not consume. The Stop hook still owns the real consume-once drain
  (signal.drain_inbox). We only detect arrivals. We never write self_delivered.
- High-water `seen` set: peek keeps returning a message until the ignited turn's
  Stop hook consumes it, so we announce each id exactly once.
- Prime on first poll: existing pending mail is marked seen WITHOUT emitting —
  it's delivered by the normal Stop-hook drain. We only announce messages that
  arrive AFTER the listener starts (those are the "events").
- Resilient: a transient daemon hiccup logs to stderr (not an event) and the
  loop continues. stdout is reserved exclusively for message events.
- Adaptive cadence: poll fast (5s) so a live exchange feels real-time, but back
  off (x2 each idle poll, up to 60s) when the channel is quiet so watching a
  silent inbox costs almost nothing. The moment a message lands, snap back to 5s
  — an active back-and-forth stays responsive. A daemon-down/error counts as
  idle (keep backing off, don't hammer a dead socket).

Usage: self_inbox_poller.py [session_id] [fast_seconds=5] [slow_seconds=60] [backoff=2.0]
       session_id falls back to $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID when omitted.
