"""Pre-response recall — thin wrapper that calls daemon for recall + judge.

The daemon handles everything: Layer 1 recall, Layer 2 Haiku judge, Layer 3 graph expansion.
This script just passes the user message to the daemon and prints the result.

Flow:
1. Send user message to daemon via "hook_recall" command
2. Daemon does recall → judge → graph expand → formats additionalContext
3. This script prints the result (additionalContext), or nothing at all
