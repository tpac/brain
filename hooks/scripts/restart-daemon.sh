# Restart the brain daemon — clears cache, re-execs with fresh code.
# Usage: hooks/scripts/restart-daemon.sh
#
# The wire protocol and the daemon address both have owners in Python
# (daemon_client.send_command, daemon_config); this script is a thin CLI over
# them, not a second implementation. Sourcing the resolver first gives us
# PLUGIN_ROOT and the venv Python.

# `cd` to the tree we import from, and use its OWN interpreter:
#   * `python3 -c` puts the CWD at sys.path[0], AHEAD of PYTHONPATH — run from a
#     directory that happens to contain a `servers` package and we would import
#     THAT one. cd makes the intended tree the cwd, so the two agree.
#   * $BRAIN_PYTHON is the venv interpreter every other brain entry point uses;
#     bare `python3` is only the venv's when brain-env.sh got far enough to
#     prepend it to PATH.
# `cd ""` returns 0 and stays put in bash, zsh and dash — an emptiness test is
# the only thing that actually catches an unresolved PLUGIN_ROOT here.
