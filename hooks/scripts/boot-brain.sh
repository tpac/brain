🧠 Anchor — setup in progress

Your brain is initializing: local runtime, embedding model, memory database,
and the brain daemon are being set up automatically — no action needed for
those. Memory storage, history traces, and direct recall work from this
session on.

One step remains to complete setup — learning (writing new memories) and
automatic memory surfacing use the Anthropic API and need your key:

  → Open http://localhost:${DASHBOARD_PORT:-47303}/setup and paste it there.
    (That's your brain's local dashboard — it also shows what Anchor
    remembers, recalls and learns. Local-only, nothing leaves this machine.
    On a brand-new install the page comes alive when the first-run setup
    finishes, ~1-2 minutes.)

  Alternatives: the Anchor plugin's settings in Claude Code — fill the
  "Anthropic API key" field, then start a new session (it's applied at
  session start). Or the env file directly:
     mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-\$HOME/.config}/brain"
     printf 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...\n' > "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-\$HOME/.config}/brain/env"
     chmod 600 "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-\$HOME/.config}/brain/env"

Get a key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys — the dashboard
and env-file paths take effect on your next message, no restart needed.

🧠 Anchor — your existing brain needs one pointer

An existing brain (memories intact) was found at:

    $BRAIN_ADOPTION_CANDIDATE

but it lives at an old install location this session's hooks can no longer
reach automatically (this happens after the plugin is renamed or
reinstalled). Nothing was created, moved, or deleted — this session runs
without memory rather than silently starting a new, empty brain.

Pick one, then start a new session:

  1. MOVE IT to the standard location (recommended — plugin renames,
     updates, and uninstalls never touch it). One command does it safely:
     stops the daemon under the maintenance lock, verifies the copy, keeps
     the original as a renamed spare, and restores services:
       bash '$(_sq "$(dirname "$0")")/relocate-brain.sh' $_CAND_Q
     No pointer needed afterwards — it is found there automatically.

  2. KEEP IT WHERE IT IS — point Anchor at it:
       mkdir -p $_CFG_Q
       printf "\nBRAIN_DB_DIR='%s'\n" $_CAND_Q >> $_CFG_Q/env
     (or set the brain path field in the Anchor plugin's settings to that
      same folder)
     ⚠ That folder is deleted by a default \`claude plugin uninstall\`
       (only --keep-data spares it). A relocation notice will repeat each
       session; silence it with BRAIN_PARKED_ACK=1 in $_CFG_Q/env.

  3. START FRESH — leave the old brain untouched on disk and begin a new
     one at the standard location:
       mkdir -p $_CFG_Q
       printf "\nBRAIN_DB_DIR='%s'\n" '$(_sq "$_XDG_FRESH")' >> $_CFG_Q/env

Claude: present these three options to the user now, with the exact commands
above — everything needed is in this notice, no lookups required. Do not
run the commands or create/move/delete anything yourself unless the user
explicitly chooses an option and asks you to apply it. This notice repeats
every session until the brain is moved or BRAIN_DB_DIR is set.
EOF
    echo "[brain-boot] adoption net: candidate brain at $BRAIN_ADOPTION_CANDIDATE — refused silent create" >&2
    exit 0
  fi
  cat <<EOF

brain: No brain.db found and auto-create failed.

Two options:

  1. CONNECT TO EXISTING BRAIN — point Anchor at your brain folder:
       mkdir -p $_CFG_Q
       printf "\nBRAIN_DB_DIR='%s'\n" '/path/to/your/brain/folder' >> $_CFG_Q/env
     The folder should contain (or will contain) brain.db.

  2. START FRESH — create a new brain at the standard location:
       mkdir -p '$(_sq "$_XDG_FRESH")'
     Then restart this session. The brain will initialize automatically.

Searched locations:
  - \$BRAIN_DB_DIR env var (not set)
  - $_CFG_FILE/env BRAIN_DB_DIR= (not set)
  - $_XDG_FRESH/ (standard — not found, create failed)
  - /sessions/*/mnt/AgentsContext/brain/ (Cowork — not found)
  - \$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/brain/ ($([ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA" ] && echo "not found at $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/brain" || echo "\$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA not set"))
  - \$HOME/AgentsContext/brain/ (not found, legacy)

🧠 Anchor — your brain lives in a folder \`claude plugin uninstall\` deletes

Memory works normally this session, but the brain's files sit at:

    $BRAIN_HOST_PARKED

A plugin UPDATE is safe there; a default UNINSTALL deletes that whole folder,
memories included (only \`claude plugin uninstall $_P_ID --keep-data\` spares
it). Recommended: move the brain to the standard location, which no plugin
operation ever touches. One command does it safely — stops the daemon under
the maintenance lock, verifies the copy, keeps the original as a renamed
spare, and restores services:

    bash '$(_sq "$(dirname "$0")")/relocate-brain.sh'

Then start a new session. Prefer to stay put? Silence this notice with
BRAIN_PARKED_ACK=1 in $BRAIN_ENV_FILE

Claude: tell the user. Run the script only if they explicitly ask. This
notice repeats at each new session until the brain is moved or acknowledged.
