# brain — Stop hook: records the turn (S0 traces) and delivers pending self-messages.
# Output: {"decision":"block","reason":...} only when a self-message must be
# delivered (the host continues the turn with it); otherwise nothing.
#
# Pure shim: env setup + exec. ALL policy (daemon liveness, unconfigured-install
# ANCHOR OFFLINE, recovery) lives in the python client / hook_common — the
# daemon owns everything behind it. Do not add gates here.
